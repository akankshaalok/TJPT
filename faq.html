       <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
           <h5>Note: the dentures are just filler content for formatting purposes. much like real dentures.</h5>
           <h5>Note note: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAkYxonUFe8">this</a> is a really good song!</h5>

           <h5>How can I whiten my dentures?</h5>
           <p>It is not possible to whiten dentures like natural teeth because dentures are made of plastic. To minimize staining, properly clean your dentures daily to remove food and plaque bacteria. Brushing with a denture brush or soft toothbrush will prevent dentures from becoming permanently stained and keep your mouth healthy. Moisten the brush and apply a non-abrasive soap or denture paste (regular toothpaste is too abrasive). Brush every surface, inside and out, scrubbing gently. A variety of over-the-counter denture cleanser products may be safely used (by following the manufacturer’s instructions) to remove most stains. A weekly 10 minute soak in dilute household bleach is recommended but discuss it with your dentist first. However More stubborn stains may require removal by your dentist or prosthodontist. a specialist in denture care and maintenance.</p>
           <h5>Can I brush my dentures with toothpaste?</h5>
           <p>>No, toothpastes are designed to be used on teeth, and they often contain materials and chemicals that help whiten and strengthen teeth, but may harm dentures, which are made of a very durable plastic. Even though the plastic is strong, it is not as strong as the enamel of teeth and may be scratched by using toothpaste to clean your dentures. You should use a dish washing liquid and a special denture brush to clean your dentures by hand every day. After rinsing them thoroughly, soak your dentures in water-based cleaning solution overnight. Do not use bleach on your dentures unless your dentist or prosthodontist gives you special instructions on using bleach. Dilute household bleach can be used to clean and disinfect your denture, but don’t use bleach until you see your dentist for instructions.</p>
           <h5>How do I repair broken dentures?</h5>
           <p>The best solution is to return to the dentist or prosthodontist who made your dentures and have the cracked denture repaired professionally. It may seem easy to fix, but it is important that the repair is done correctly to prevent problems with chewing and to avoid any sore spots. The dentist also needs to check the denture and adjust it after it is repaired. The denture may be too old and may no longer fit closely to your gums, and you may need a new denture.</p>
           <h5>Can I sleep in my dentures?</h5>
           <p>Yes, you can wear your dentures at night but it is preferred that they be removed. You should remove your dentures at night and this will give your gums and bone a chance to relax from the pressure of the denture during the day. If you need to wear your dentures for social reasons or to prevent your jaws from over closing, you should find time during the day to properly clean your mouth and your prostheses. You should never wear your dentures 24 hours a day without preforming proper oral hygiene. Dentures should be cleaned at night and stored in water during the night. Dentures can be made to look like your teeth or, if you want changes in your teeth, the dentures can be made to improve your appearance. You should work with your dentist or prosthodontist and tell him/her how you would like to look. You may want to seek the care of a prosthodontist, a dental specialist with three years of additional training in the restoration and replacement of teeth, including dentures.</p>
           <h5>Can I eat normally with dentures?</h5>
           <p>Most patients need to learn how use dentures properly and as a result, it takes a little time to get used to them. After a while, you should be able to eat fairly normally, but it may take more time to get comfortable with harder foods or sticky foods. Using a small amount of denture adhesive (no more than three or four pea-sized dabs on each denture) may help stabilize the dentures and help hold them in place while you learn how to get comfortable with them and may make the learning process easier.</p>
           <h5>Can I chew sugarless gum with dentures?</h5>
           <p>Dentures and chewing gum do not usually work well together, no matter which brand of chewing gum you decide to try. The gum typically sticks to the acrylic plastic in the denture and may break a seal on the dentures, which will loosen them as a result. Gum may remain stuck to the denture and eventually harden and discolor. Ultimately, if you wear dentures, you should avoid chewing gum.</p>
